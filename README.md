# Portfolio Master File - Contains a list of all the projects I have personally completed. If the particular git repo is not part of this list then it was completed as part of a tutorial series. 


## Completed Projects



## Incomplete Projects
[Basic JavaScript Calculator](https://github.com/Tsukiyonocm/Calculator) - this particular project will make use of no libraries. Will be vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. This particular version will only take into account very simple arithmatic and will likely need much retooling even from there in order to be a viable calculator. The point here is just to see if I can figure out the basic logic to get it working on a most basic level.
