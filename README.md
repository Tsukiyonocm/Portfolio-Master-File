# Portfolio Master File - Contains a list of all the projects I have personally completed. If the particular git repo is not part of this list then it was completed as part of a tutorial series. 


## Completed Projects
[FrontLoops 1-1](https://tsukiyonocm.github.io/FrontLoops-1-1/) - Creating a simple sales card which showcases 3 different tiers of services. Its currently not responsive, but it is complete based on the design guidelines. 

[FrontLoops 1-2](https://tsukiyonocm.github.io/FrontLoops-1-2/) - Creating a simple payout form. On this portion of the form, you can select between different payments and there is a checkmark that tells you which was selected. I opted to make the three options clickable so that the checkmark bounces between them based on the click. This was beyond the scope and really did it to mess around with some JavaScript a bit.

[FrontLoops 1-3](https://tsukiyonocm.github.io/FrontLoops-1-3/) - This was a simple checkout card. It showcased company name and profile icon, order and totals. There is also a very simple hover effect on the profile icon. 



## Incomplete Projects
[Personal Web Page 1.0](https://tsukiyonocm.github.io/Personal/) - This will be my first completed and personal website. I currently only have the mobile navigation setup and am currently working on the rest. I will likely update this in the future as I learn things to make it run much smoother and utilize the new skillsets I am learning. I am also utilizing this project to better understand Git workflow in addition, as I am making everything in its own branches and then merging them after they are complete. This project is also utlizing SASS for a CSS preprocessor for learning purposes.
